## Purpose

네이버쇼핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자처럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- 2026-06-15T06:00Z **서브타입 소싱-마찰 스크린 완료 (L0 cloud research).** 도난방지 스트랩: **ADVANCE** — 스프링줄+카라비너 서브타입이 소싱 마찰 낮음(Alibaba/1688/국내 도매 MOQ 50-200개, FOB $0.50-$2.00), 옵션 단순(색상+단품), 훅/카라비너 품질이 유일 리스크. 다음 단계: 샘플 발주 비용 승인(₩50,000-₩150,000, L2, GATES.md 등록). 압축파우치: **CONDITIONAL WATCH** — 사이즈/지퍼 옵션 복잡도 HIGH, 브랜드 경쟁 포화, 단품 M 단사이즈로 재탐색 필요("백팩여행압축파우치" / "기내수하물압축파우치"). 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/subtype-sourcing-friction-screen-2026-06-15.md`. 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0600Z-sourcing-friction.html`. 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0.

- 2026-06-15T00:14Z **Ready-made sourcing OpenAPI/SearchAd screen completed.** Frozen keyword set was tested with read-only Naver OpenAPI Shopping Search and SearchAd. No user-facing listing/sourcing approval yet. **Phone anti-theft strap / tether component becomes the WATCH lead** because exact SearchAd signal is strongest (`핸드폰도난방지스트랩` 280 PC + 1,500 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 4.26%; `도난방지스트랩` 280 + 1,260/mo, mobile CTR 3.28%) and OpenAPI title language is clean around Europe travel / pickpocket / loss-prevention. **Compression / packing pouch remains WATCH** (`압축파우치` 1,230 PC + 7,020 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 3.21%) but has crowded textile/option/return burden. **Cable/charger pouch drops to HOLD as lead** because exact SearchAd signal is thin despite OpenAPI result breadth. Next safe pass: subtype-level sourcing-friction screen for phone strap/tether and compression pouch before any approval packet. Artifact: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/ready-made-sourcing-openapi-searchad-screen-2026-06-15.md`; report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0014Z-local.html`. Live commerce/account/public actions 0.

- 2026-06-14T05:45Z **User-side setup blockers promoted to visible Infinity Waiting.** User corrected that Commerce ID and similar user setup requirements should be actively placed in Infinity Waiting. `INTENTS.md` now keeps `naver-shopping-01` active for sourcing-first research, but also exposes a Waiting decision card for SmartStore Commerce ID, read-only browser access, and public Naver Shopping search restriction. SAM/Narae should continue OpenAPI/SearchAd/official/public research while waiting; no live commerce/account action occurs.

- 2026-06-13T0607Z **소싱-퍼스트 스크린 라운드 1 (cloud research).** 2026-06-11 사용자 선호 업데이트(소싱 중심, 러기지택 내렸) 이후 첫 소싱-퍼스트 스크린 수행. 탈락 확정 항목(러기지택, 종이 카드 인서트, 트래블러스노트 속지, 워크샵/질문 카드)을 제외하고 신규 후보 5개 카테고리 평가: ① **포토 포켓 앨범 / 여행 사진 앨범** (사용자 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 옵션 복잡도 낮음 → DataLab 1순위), ② **투명 스티커 세트 / 다꾸 스티커** (기록/일상시스템 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 디자인 테마 차별화 가능 → DataLab 1순위), ③ **케이블/전자기기 파우치** (여행+크리에이터 fit ★★ → DataLab 2순위), ④ **여행 메모 스탬프** (소싱 마찰 중간 → DataLab 3순위), ⑤ **씰 봉투 / 레터셋** (여행 기록 fit ★★ → DataLab 3순위). 구매 상황 우선(m50 기준): 포토 앨범='여행 다녀온 후 사진 정리', 스티커='다이어리 꾸미기'. Naver Shopping/DataLab 접근 없음(cloud-only). 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0. 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/sourcing-first-screen-round1-2026-06-13.md`, 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-13T0607Z-research.html`.

- 2026-06-11T00:35Z **User preference update → sourcing-first, luggage tags downgraded.** User said Narae should focus more on sourcing than product-making, and that luggage tags are not a preferred product. Narae workspace docs now default to sourceable ready-made goods / light bundles before custom product-making, and the previous `캐리어네임택` / `러기지택` customization-differentiation branch is downgraded. Next safe work should be a broader sourcing-first screen for goods with low sample friction, low option complexity, manageable QA/return risk, and stronger user preference. No live store/listing/price/stock/shipping/ads/customer/order/account/public action occurred.

- 2026-06-11T00:08Z Traveler's-notebook insert / travel-prep general was "너무 일반적" and removed from the first SKU candidate list (user feedback at 14:09Z on Jun 10 also removed workshop/question-card monetization path from Naver revenue/SKU candidates).

- 2026-06-10T20:07Z **Paper/card-led arrival-day failure-prevention insert keyword test complete.** `해외여행 체크리스트` is a clean-ish paper/planner shelf (OpenAPI 32,278; SearchAd 310 PC + 1,750 mobile/mo) but mobile CTR 0.05% — weak buyer intent, generic checklist/planner commodity. Conclusion: **HOLD / paper-card insert is not the lead SKU**.

- 2026-06-10T18:07Z **러기지택 keyword test: HOLD 확정.** `러기지택` OpenAPI 64,764 total but top 20 dominated by custom-print/laser-engraved sellers — low margin, high option complexity. Conclusion: **HOLD / not lead SKU**.

- 2026-06-10T04:07Z **러기지택 first hypothesis formed.** Source fit: `Idea/Travel.md` has suitcase/luggage tag note. DataLab `러기지택` series has 12/12 relative presence in 여행용품 category. Next: keyword + competition validation.

- 2026-06-09T02:42Z User replied **"다 허용"** to 09:00 pending decisions. First seed approved as **Travel-Prep System / Travel Scenario Card / Checklist Insert Set**. Guide: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/agents/naver-shopping-agent/shopping-mall-operations-guide.md`.

- 2026-06-08T14:39Z Read-only test: Naver main shows logged-in affordances, but SmartStore Center stops at Commerce ID login page; public Naver Shopping search still IP-restricted.

- 2026-06-08T13:07Z SKU first-pass complete: two product hypotheses formed (Travel-Prep System, AI/creator workflow cards). Demand still UNVALIDATED.

- 2026-06-08T12:01Z Naver QR login session confirmed in live browser session.

- independent agent workspace exists
- user-facing name is fixed as **나래 / Narae**; internal id/path remains `naver-shopping-agent`
- silent work loop is scheduled at 08:30 KST
- visible report is scheduled at 09:00 KST
- user wants SAM to handle anything SAM can handle
- user wants to check only at 09:00 KST
- user clarified that product curation is a core job and that matching the user's taste matters
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki should be used as source context for product-fit judgment
- scoped normal GitHub push is allowed so Infinity/Naver-agent state becomes visible remotely

## Pending Blockers

### 2026-06-08T03:00Z - Commerce ID 확인 필요

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- blocker: SmartStore Commerce ID login wall — 사용자가 Commerce ID로 로그인해야 SmartStore 대시보드 접근 가능.
- user_needed: Commerce ID 로그인 확인 또는 이전 ID에서 전환 완료 확인.
- sam_action: public research, strategy, competitor/category investigation 계속.
- work_continues: yes

### 2026-06-07T23:24Z - 네이버 로그인/스토어 권한 확인

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- blocker: SmartStore/Naver account state and read-only browser access are not yet confirmed.
- user_needed: confirm/login/open browser session if read-only dashboard inspection is desired.
- sam_action: continue public research, strategy updates, metric-method discovery, and competitor/category investigation.
- work_continues: yes

### 2026-06-07T23:28Z - 네이버쇼핑 공개 검색 접근 제한

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- blocker: Direct public Naver Shopping searches from the agent host returned a temporary shopping-service access restriction page.
- user_needed: confirm whether a user-opened browser/profile can be used for read-only Naver Shopping and SmartStore checks.
- sam_action: continue official-source research, strategy updates, metric-method design, and category-scan template preparation.
- work_continues: yes

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

When a blocker requires the user's settings, identity/session confirmation, account access, or approval, register it in `INTENTS.md` Waiting with `decision/options/default/reason/next` metadata even if parallel research can continue. Active work and visible Waiting can coexist.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes, because the user explicitly requested that updates be pushed quickly so Infinity can see them.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
