## Purpose

네이버쇼핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자처럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- 2026-06-13T0607Z **소싱-퍼스트 스크린 라운드 1 (cloud research).** 2026-06-11 사용자 선호 업데이트(소싱 중심, 러기지택 내림) 이후 첫 소싱-퍼스트 스크린 수행. 탈락 확정 항목(러기지택, 종이 카드 인서트, 트래블러스노트 속지, 워크샵/질문 카드)을 제외하고 신규 후보 5개 카테고리 평가: ① **포토 포켓 앨범 / 여행 사진 앨범** (사용자 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 옵션 복잡도 낮음 → DataLab 1순위), ② **투명 스티커 세트 / 다꾸 스티커** (기록/일상시스템 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 디자인 테마 차별화 가능 → DataLab 1순위), ③ **케이블/전자기기 파우치** (여행+크리에이터 fit ★★ → DataLab 2순위), ④ **여행 메모 스탬프** (소싱 마찰 중간 → DataLab 3순위), ⑤ **씰 봉투 / 레터셋** (여행 기록 fit ★★ → DataLab 3순위). 구매 상황 우선(m50 기준): 포토 앨범='여행 다녀온 후 사진 정리', 스티커='다이어리 꾸미기'. Naver Shopping/DataLab 접근 없음(cloud-only). 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0. 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/sourcing-first-screen-round1-2026-06-13.md`, 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-13T0607Z-research.html`.

- 2026-06-11T00:35Z **User preference update → sourcing-first, luggage tags downgraded.** User said Narae should focus more on sourcing than product-making, and that luggage tags are not a preferred product. Narae workspace docs now default to sourceable ready-made goods / light bundles before custom product-making, and the previous `캐리어네임택` / `러기지택` customization-differentiation branch is downgraded. Next safe work should be a broader sourcing-first screen for goods with low sample friction, low option complexity, manageable QA/return risk, and stronger user preference. No live store/listing/price/stock/shipping/ads/customer/order/account/public action occurred.

- 2026-06-10T23:30Z **Question/workshop-card sourcing-friction screen added (docs-only).** Marketer `marketing-50` already selected the purchase situation before object shape: AI/creator workshop facilitation cards. This pass converted that positioning into a practical SKU gate: validate small-batch production route, MOQ, unit cost, card/box spec, category/product-info friction, and margin floor before any listing-direction approval. Verdict unchanged: **DRAFT / copy-led, not listing-ready**. No new Naver calls, no live store/listing/price/stock/shipping/ads/customer/order/account/public action. Artifact: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/agents/naver-shopping-agent/question-workshop-card-sourcing-friction-screen-2026-06-10.md`.

- 2026-06-11T00:08Z Traveler's-notebook insert / travel-prep general was "too general" and removed from the first SKU candidate list.

- 2026-06-10T20:07Z **Paper/card-led arrival-day failure-prevention insert keyword test complete.** `해외여행 체크리스트` is a clean-ish paper/planner shelf (OpenAPI 32,278; SearchAd 310 PC + 1,750 mobile/mo) but mobile CTR 0.05% — weak buyer intent, generic checklist/planner commodity. `여행 준비 카드`/`여행 체크리스트 카드` have trading cards/photo-card holders/boards/wallets/imported goods noise. Emergency/safety/contact-card language is story-rich but keyword-weak/non-travel/privacy-sensitive. Conclusion: **HOLD / paper-card insert is not the lead SKU**. Artifact: `naver-shopping-agent/arrival-day-insert-keyword-test-2026-06-10.md`, report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-10T2007Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-10T18:07Z Arrival-day failure-prevention insert angle explored — keyword test plan prepared. No live store action.

- 2026-06-10T19:07Z Arrival-day failure angle revised — moving toward paper/card insert. No live action.

- independent agent workspace exists
- user-facing name is fixed as **나래 / Narae**; internal id/path remains `naver-shopping-agent`
- silent work loop is scheduled at 08:30 KST
- visible report is scheduled at 09:00 KST
- blocker routing is being connected to Infinity
- user wants SAM to handle anything SAM can handle
- user wants to check only at 09:00 KST
- user clarified that product curation is a core job and that matching the user's taste matters
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki should be used as source context for product-fit judgment
- scoped normal GitHub push is allowed so Infinity/Naver-agent state becomes visible remotely

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes, because the user explicitly requested that updates be pushed quickly so Infinity can see them.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
