## Purpose

네이버쇼핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자처럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- independent agent workspace exists
- silent work loop is scheduled at 08:30 KST
- visible report is scheduled at 09:00 KST
- blocker routing is being connected to Infinity
- user wants SAM to handle anything SAM can handle
- user wants to check only at 09:00 KST
- user clarified that product curation is a core job and that matching the user's taste matters
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki should be used as source context for product-fit judgment
- scoped normal GitHub push is allowed so Infinity/Naver-agent state becomes visible remotely
- Naver QR login session was confirmed in the live browser session on 2026-06-08T12:01Z; read-only checks may proceed while the session remains valid
- **2026-06-08T14:00Z**: Cloud prepare 완료 — 상품 후보 5종(여행 파우치, 메모리 다이어리, 패킹 큐브, 창작자 노트, 포터블 메모 시스템) 수요 신호·사용자 적합성 1차 매핑. 로컬 브라우저로 경쟁가 확인 필요. 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-08T1400Z-prepare.html`

## Active Blockers

## Next Action (Local — Browser Session Required)

- 후보 5종 네이버 쇼핑 검색량·경쟁가·리뷰 수 확인
- 스마트스토어 상위 3개 경쟁 상품 비교
- 실제 마진 계산 (도매가 조사)
- 등록 마찰 확인 (카테고리 매칭·원산지)

## Resolved Decision

- decision: 네이버/스마트스토어 읽기 전용 브라우저 세션을 써도 될까요?
- decision_result: 허용
- resolved_at: 2026-06-08T12:01Z
- evidence: QR login approval moved the same browser session to the logged-in Naver main page.
- reason: 실계정 대시보드와 네이버쇼핑 검색을 확인해야 경쟁상품/지표 검증이 정확해집니다.
- next: 로그인된 브라우저로 읽기 전용 확인만 진행
- dashboard_summary: 네이버/스마트스토어 읽기 전용 접근 여부

### 2026-06-08T12:01Z - 사용자 QR 로그인 완료 / Waiting 해제

- route: user-session-confirmed
- status: active
- source: Telegram QR login flow + live browser snapshot
- evidence: same browser session opened the logged-in Naver main page after QR approval
- user_needed: none for read-only Naver Shopping / SmartStore checks while the session remains valid
- sam_action: resume read-only Naver Shopping / SmartStore checks; keep write, account, customer, budget, and publishing actions behind approval
- work_continues: yes
- next_9am_message: report only meaningful findings or new user-side blockers

### 2026-06-07T23:24Z - 초기 네이버 로그인/스토어 권한 확인

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- source: `questions-for-9am.md`
- blocker: SmartStore/Naver account state and read-only browser access are not yet confirmed.
- user_needed: confirm/login/open browser session if read-only dashboard inspection is desired.
- sam_action: continue public research, strategy updates, metric-method discovery, and competitor/category investigation.
- work_continues: yes
- next_9am_message: ask in one batch with other queued questions.

### 2026-06-07T23:28Z - 네이버쇼핑 공개 검색 접근 제한

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- source: `browser-access.md`, `research-log.md`
- blocker: Direct public Naver Shopping searches from the agent host returned a temporary shopping-service access restriction page, so automated competitor scans on Naver Shopping cannot be completed from this host right now.
- user_needed: confirm whether a user-opened browser/profile can be used for read-only Naver Shopping and SmartStore checks.
- sam_action: continue official-source research, strategy updates, metric-method design, and category-scan template preparation without retrying aggressively.
- work_continues: yes
- next_9am_message: include with the browser/read-only access questions.

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes, because the user explicitly requested that updates be pushed quickly so Infinity can see them.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
