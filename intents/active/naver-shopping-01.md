## Purpose

네이버쇼핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자자럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- 2026-06-15T01:15Z **Subtype sourcing-friction screen completed.** Phone strap 3 subtypes + Compression pouch 2 subtypes screened. **Wrist strap (PROCEED FIRST)**: minimal sourcing friction (1688, MOQ 1, ~1,000-3,000 KRW), low return risk, clear "분실방지/낙하방지" travel angle. **Laundry/dirty-clothes pouch (PROCEED FIRST)**: low competition (OpenAPI 3,879 vs 175,568 for general compression), good margin (~50-70%), clear hygiene-separation use case. Tag-holder adhesive patch (AVOID): adhesive residue/case-damage claim risk high. Simple compression set (HOLD): saturated category, margin under pressure. Next safe action: 1688 supplier candidates for wrist strap + laundry pouch. Live commerce/account/public actions 0. Artifact: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/subtype-sourcing-friction-screen-2026-06-15.md`, report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0115Z-cloud.html`.

- 2026-06-15T00:14Z **Ready-made sourcing OpenAPI/SearchAd screen completed.** Frozen keyword set was tested with read-only Naver OpenAPI Shopping Search and SearchAd. No user-facing listing/sourcing approval yet. **Phone anti-theft strap / tether component becomes the WATCH lead** because exact SearchAd signal is strongest (`핸드폰도난방지스트랩` 280 PC + 1,500 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 4.26%; `도난방지스트랩` 280 + 1,260/mo, mobile CTR 3.28%) and OpenAPI title language is clean around Europe travel / pickpocket / loss-prevention. **Compression / packing pouch remains WATCH** (`압축파우치` 1,230 PC + 7,020 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 3.21%) but has crowded textile/option/return burden. **Cable/charger pouch drops to HOLD as lead** because exact SearchAd signal is thin despite OpenAPI result breadth. Next safe pass: subtype-level sourcing-friction screen for phone strap/tether and compression pouch before any approval packet. Artifact: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/ready-made-sourcing-openapi-searchad-screen-2026-06-15.md`; report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0014Z-local.html`. Live commerce/account actions 0.

- 2026-06-14T05:45Z **User-side setup blockers promoted to visible Infinity Waiting.** User corrected that Commerce ID and similar user setup requirements should be actively placed in Infinity Waiting. `INTENTS.md` now keeps `naver-shopping-01` active for sourcing-first research, but also exposes a Waiting decision card for SmartStore Commerce ID, read-only browser access, and public Naver Shopping search restriction. SAM/Narae should continue OpenAPI/SearchAd/official/public research while waiting; no live commerce/account action occurs.

- 2026-06-13T0607Z **소싱-퍼스트 스크린 라운드 1 (cloud research).** 2026-06-11 사용자 선호 업데이트(소싱 중심, 러기지택 내렸) 이후 첫 소싱-퍼스트 스크린 수행. 탈락 확정 항목(러기지택, 종이 카드 인서트, 트래블러스노트 속지, 워크샵/질문 카드)을 제외하고 신규 후보 5개 카테고리 평가: ① **포토 포켓 앨범 / 여행 사진 앨범** (사용자 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 옵션 복잡도 낙음 → DataLab 1순위), ② **투명 스티커 세트 / 다꾸 스티커** (기록/일상시스템 fit ★★★, 소싱 용이, 디자인 테마 차별화 가능 → DataLab 1순위), ③ **케이블/전자기기 파우치** (여행+크리에이터 fit ★★ → DataLab 2순위), ④ **여행 메모 스탬프** (소싱 마찰 중간 → DataLab 3순위), ⑤ **씰 봉투 / 레터셋** (여행 기록 fit ★★ → DataLab 3순위). Naver Shopping/DataLab 접근 없음(cloud-only). 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0. 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/sourcing-first-screen-round1-2026-06-13.md`, 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-13T0607Z-research.html`.

- 2026-06-11T00:35Z **User preference update → sourcing-first, luggage tags downgraded.** User said Narae should focus more on sourcing than product-making, and that luggage tags are not a preferred product. Narae workspace docs now default to sourceable ready-made goods / light bundles before custom product-making, and the previous `캐리어네임택` / `러기지택` customization-differentiation branch is downgraded. Next safe work should be a broader sourcing-first screen for goods with low sample friction, low option complexity, manageable QA/return risk, and stronger user preference. No live store/listing/price/stock/shipping/ads/customer/order/account/public action occurred.

- 2026-06-10T20:07Z **Paper/card-led arrival-day failure-prevention insert keyword test complete.** Conclusion: **HOLD / paper-card insert is not the lead SKU**. Report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-10T2007Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-10T18:07Z **러기지택 keyword test: HOLD 확정.** Conclusion: **HOLD / not lead SKU**. Report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-10T1807Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-09T04:07Z **DataLab access restored → first seed PARTIALLY validated.** Insert-format PIVOT → luggage tag PIVOT → sourcing-first pivot. Report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-09T0407Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-09T02:42Z User replied **"다 허용"** to 09:00 pending decisions. First seed approved as Travel-Prep System / Travel Scenario Card / Checklist Insert Set.

## Pending Blockers

### 2026-06-08T03:00Z - Commerce ID 확인 필요

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- blocker: SmartStore Commerce ID login wall
- sam_action: public research, strategy, competitor/category investigation 계속.
- work_continues: yes

### 2026-06-07T23:28Z - 네이버쇼핑 공개 검색 접근 제한

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- blocker: Direct public Naver Shopping searches from the agent host return access restriction.
- sam_action: continue official-source research, strategy updates, metric-method design.
- work_continues: yes

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
