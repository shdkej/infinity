## Purpose

네이버쓰핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자처럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- 2026-06-15T0900Z **1688 손목 스트랩 소싱 브리프 준비 완료 (cloud prepare).** 손목 스트랩 GREEN 확정 후 1688 샘플 조회를 위한 클라우드 준비 완료. 검색 키워드 5개(手机防盗绳手腕 1순위), 상품 유형 우선순위(클립형 1순위), 공급업체 평가 체크리스트 7항목, 로컬 실행 7단계 순서 정리. **다음 단계: 로컬 브라우저에서 1688 샘플 조회 실행.** 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/1688-wrist-strap-sample-brief-2026-06-15.md`; 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0900Z-research.html`. 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0.

- 2026-06-15T0200Z **소싱 마찰 스크린 완료.** 휴대폰 스트랩/테더 3가지(손목·크로스바디·태그홀더) + 압축 파우치 2가지(여행 세트·세탁물 분리)를 소싱 마찰 기준으로 평가. **손목 스트랩(분실·낙하 방지 보조 줄) GREEN: 저마찰·저클레임·안정적 마진.** 압축 파우치 WATCH→HOLD 하향(경쟁 포화 175,568 리스팅 + QA·클레임 부담). 크로스바디 스트랩은 2차 후보(손목 스트랩 샘플 성공 후 재검토). 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0. 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/sourcing-friction-screen-2026-06-15.md`; 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0200Z-research.html`.

- 2026-06-15T00:14Z **Ready-made sourcing OpenAPI/SearchAd screen completed.** Frozen keyword set was tested with read-only Naver OpenAPI Shopping Search and SearchAd. No user-facing listing/sourcing approval yet. **Phone anti-theft strap / tether component becomes the WATCH lead** because exact SearchAd signal is strongest (`핸드폰도난방지스트랩` 280 PC + 1,500 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 4.26%; `도난방지스트랩` 280 + 1,260/mo, mobile CTR 3.28%) and OpenAPI title language is clean around Europe travel / pickpocket / loss-prevention. **Compression / packing pouch remains WATCH** (`압축파우치` 1,230 PC + 7,020 mobile/mo, mobile CTR 3.21%) but has crowded textile/option/return burden. **Cable/charger pouch drops to HOLD as lead** because exact SearchAd buyer signal is thin despite OpenAPI result breadth. Next safe pass: subtype-level sourcing-friction screen for phone strap/tether and compression pouch before any approval packet. Artifact: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/ready-made-sourcing-openapi-searchad-screen-2026-06-15.md`; report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-15T0014Z-local.html`. Live commerce/account/public actions 0.

- 2026-06-14T05:45Z **User-side setup blockers promoted to visible Infinity Waiting.** User corrected that Commerce ID and similar user setup requirements should be actively placed in Infinity Waiting. `INTENTS.md` now keeps `naver-shopping-01` active for sourcing-first research, but also exposes a Waiting decision card for SmartStore Commerce ID, read-only browser access, and public Naver Shopping search restriction. SAM/Narae should continue OpenAPI/SearchAd/official/public research while waiting; no live commerce/account action occurs.

- 2026-06-13T0607Z **소싱-퍼스트 스크린 라운드 1 (cloud research).** 2026-06-11 사용자 선호 업데이트(소싱 중심, 러기지택 내렸) 이후 첫 소싱-퍼스트 스크린 수행. 탈락 확정 항목(러기지택, 종이 카드 인서트, 트래블러스노트 속지, 워크샵/질문 카드)을 제외하고 신규 후보 5개 카테고리 평가. 라이브 상품등록/가격·배송·재고/광고·고객·주문·계정·공개발행 0. 산출물: `artifacts/naver-shopping-01/sourcing-first-screen-round1-2026-06-13.md`, 리포트: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-13T0607Z-research.html`.

- 2026-06-11T00:35Z **User preference update → sourcing-first, luggage tags downgraded.** User said Narae should focus more on sourcing than product-making, and that luggage tags are not a preferred product. Narae workspace docs now default to sourceable ready-made goods / light bundles before custom product-making, and the previous `케리어네임택` / `러기지택` customization-differentiation branch is downgraded. Next safe work should be a broader sourcing-first screen for goods with low sample friction, low option complexity, manageable QA/return risk, and stronger user preference. No live store/listing/price/stock/shipping/ads/customer/order/account/public action occurred.

- 2026-06-11T00:08Z Traveler's-notebook insert / travel-prep general was "너무 일반적" and removed from the first SKU candidate list (user feedback at 14:09Z on Jun 10 also removed workshop/question-card monetization path from Naver revenue/SKU candidates).

- 2026-06-10T20:07Z **Paper/card-led arrival-day failure-prevention insert keyword test complete.** `해외여행 체크리스트` is a clean-ish paper/planner shelf (OpenAPI 32,278; SearchAd 310 PC + 1,750 mobile/mo) but mobile CTR 0.05% — weak buyer intent, generic checklist/planner commodity. Conclusion: **HOLD / paper-card insert is not the lead SKU**. Artifact: `naver-shopping-agent/arrival-day-insert-keyword-test-2026-06-10.md`, report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-10T2007Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-10T18:07Z **러기지택 keyword test: HOLD 확정.** `러기지택` OpenAPI 64,764 total but top 20 dominated by custom-print/laser-engraved sellers — low margin, high option complexity. Conclusion: **HOLD / not lead SKU**. Artifact: `naver-shopping-agent/luggage-tag-keyword-test-2026-06-10.md`, report: `reports/naver-shopping-01/2026-06-10T1807Z-local.html`.

- 2026-06-09T02:42Z User replied **"다 허용"** to 09:00 pending decisions. First seed approved as **Travel-Prep System / Travel Scenario Card / Checklist Insert Set**. Guide: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/agents/naver-shopping-agent/shopping-mall-operations-guide.md`.

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

When a blocker requires the user's settings, identity/session confirmation, account access, or approval, register it in `INTENTS.md` Waiting with `decision/options/default/reason/next` metadata even if parallel research can continue. Active work and visible Waiting can coexist.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
