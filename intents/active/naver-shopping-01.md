# naver-shopping-01: 네이버쇼핑 에이전트 운영/차단 라우팅

- id: naver-shopping-01
- status: waiting
- projects: [naver-shopping, infinity, personal-ops]
- task_type: coordination
- topics: [automation, workflow, marketing]
- owner: SAM
- source_agent: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/agents/naver-shopping-agent/`
- created_at: 2026-06-07T23:24Z

## Purpose

네이버쇼핑몰 수익화 전담 에이전트가 막히는 지점을 SAM이 관리자처럼 분류하고, 사용자가 직접 확인해야 하는 항목만 09:00 KST 메시지로 묶는다.

## Current State

- independent agent workspace exists
- silent work loop is scheduled at 08:30 KST
- visible report is scheduled at 09:00 KST
- blocker routing is being connected to Infinity
- user wants SAM to handle anything SAM can handle
- user wants to check only at 09:00 KST
- user clarified that product curation is a core job and that matching the user's taste matters
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki should be used as source context for product-fit judgment
- scoped normal GitHub push is allowed so Infinity/Naver-agent state becomes visible remotely

## Active Blockers

### 2026-06-07T23:24Z - 초기 네이버 로그인/스토어 권한 확인

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- source: `questions-for-9am.md`
- blocker: SmartStore/Naver account state and read-only browser access are not yet confirmed.
- user_needed: confirm/login/open browser session if read-only dashboard inspection is desired.
- sam_action: continue public research, strategy updates, metric-method discovery, and competitor/category investigation.
- work_continues: yes
- next_9am_message: ask in one batch with other queued questions.

### 2026-06-07T23:28Z - 네이버쇼핑 공개 검색 접근 제한

- route: user-session-needed
- status: waiting
- source: `browser-access.md`, `research-log.md`
- blocker: Direct public Naver Shopping searches from the agent host returned a temporary shopping-service access restriction page, so automated competitor scans on Naver Shopping cannot be completed from this host right now.
- user_needed: confirm whether a user-opened browser/profile can be used for read-only Naver Shopping and SmartStore checks.
- sam_action: continue official-source research, strategy updates, metric-method design, and category-scan template preparation without retrying aggressively.
- work_continues: yes
- next_9am_message: include with the browser/read-only access questions.

## Approval Boundaries

Keep the following as Infinity Waiting items when they appear:

- product registration or live listing edit
- price, shipping, option, inventory, coupon, or promotion changes
- advertising or budget changes
- customer replies
- order, return, refund, exchange, settlement actions
- account/store setting changes
- public publishing under the user's account

## Manager Policy

SAM should not forward ordinary research or documentation blockers to the user. Those should be resolved by the Naver Shopping Agent or by SAM.

Only user-session, approval, cost, account, customer, or hard safety blockers should remain waiting.

## Product Curation Policy

The agent should curate products/categories, not merely research SmartStore tactics.

Every serious product candidate should include:

- user-fit thesis
- Knowledge Lab / agent-wiki / source-note signal
- Naver/public demand or competition signal
- margin and registration-friction note
- content angle the user can naturally produce
- measurement path
- approval boundary

Generic "hot products" should be downgraded when they do not match the user's travel, memory-making, AI/creator workflow, daily-system, or documentation rhythm.

## GitHub Sync Policy

Normal non-force GitHub push is allowed for scoped Naver Shopping Agent and Infinity state changes, because the user explicitly requested that updates be pushed quickly so Infinity can see them.

Rules:

- stage only files belonging to the Naver Shopping Agent and relevant Infinity intent/index state
- do not stage unrelated dirty files
- no force push
- no secret/token/cookie material
- if push fails, register the blocker in this intent and continue local work
